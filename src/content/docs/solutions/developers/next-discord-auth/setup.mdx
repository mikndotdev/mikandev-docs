import { Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

## Install and Configure

- Install the package:

<PackageManagers type="install" pkg="@mikandev/next-discord-auth" pkgManagers={['npm', 'pnpm' , 'bun']}/>

- Create an Auth configuration file somewhere in your project, for example `src/auth.ts`:

```ts
import { setup } from "@mikandev/next-discord-auth";

await setup({
	clientId: process.env.DISCORD_CLIENT_ID as string,
	clientSecret: process.env.DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET as string,
	redirectUri: process.env.DISCORD_REDIRECT_URI as string,
	scopes: ["identify", "email"],
	jwtSecret: process.env.JWT_SECRET as string,
});
```
- `clientId`: Your Discord application's client ID.
- `clientSecret`: Your Discord application's client secret.
- `redirectUri`: The URI to redirect to after authentication. This should match the redirect URI set in your Discord application settings.
- `scopes`: The scopes to request from Discord. Defaults to `["identify", "email"]`. Read the [Discord Developer Docs](https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/oauth2) for more information on scopes.
- `jwtSecret`: A secret used to sign the JWT tokens. This should be a long, random string. Try using `openssl rand -base64 32` to generate one, or just hit random keys on your keyboard and hope for the best :3

<Aside type="danger">Do **NOT** put your secrets directly in this file! Use environment variables instead. You can use a `.env` file to store them locally, and set them in your deployment environment.</Aside>

This package will also infer [AuthJS Environment variables](https://authjs.dev/getting-started/providers/discord#environment-variables), so if you have those set, you don't need to set the `clientId` and `clientSecret` options.

## Create a Callback Route
- Create a Route Handler on your callback route, for example `src/app/auth/callback/route.ts`:

```ts
import { handleRedirect } from "@mikandev/next-discord-auth/redirect";
import { NextRequest } from "next/server";
import { redirect } from "next/navigation";

import "@/auth";

export const GET = async (request: NextRequest) => {
	await handleRedirect(request);
	redirect("/");
};
```
Make sure to set your Discord application's redirect URI to match this route, in this case `http://localhost:3000/auth/callback`

You are now ready to [use the package](/solutions/developers/next-discord-auth/usage)!
